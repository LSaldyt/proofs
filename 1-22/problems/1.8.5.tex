    \item There exists a line in the plane passing through the points $(-1, 1), (2, -1), (3, 0)$
    \item There exists an odd prime number
    \item For all reals, $x, x^3 = x$
    \item Every positive integer is the sum of distinct powers of three
    \item For all positive real numbers $x$ there exists a real $y$ such that $y^2 = x$
    \item There exists a positive real number $y$ such that for all reals $x$, $y^2 = x$
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No line exists in the plane passing through the points $(-1, 1), (2, -1), (3, 0)$.
    \item There does not exist an odd prime number.
    \item For all reals, $x, x^3 \neq x$
    \item Every positive integer is not the sum of distinct powers of three
    \item For all positive real numbers $x$ there exists a real $y$ such that $y^2 \neq x$
    \item There exists a positive real number $y$ such that for all reals $x$, $y^2 = x$
\end{enumerate}
