\problem{Statement Negation}

Negate the following statements and attempt to write the result as a positive statement.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $x + y$ is even and $y + z$ is even.
    \item $x > 0$ and $x$ is rational.
    \item Either $l$ is parallel to $m$, or $l$ and $m$ are the same line (for fixed lines in 2D space).
    \item The roots of this polynomial are either all real or all complex. (Assume that real numbers are different from complex numbers with imaginary part 0, even though this is not true generally).
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $x + y$ is odd or $y + z$ is odd.
    \item $x < 0$ or $x$ is not rational.
    \item $l$ is not parallel to $m$ and $l$ and $m$ are the not same line (for fixed lines in 2D space.
    \item The roots of this polynomial are not all real and not all complex. (Assume that real numbers are different from complex numbers with imaginary part 0, even though this is not true generally).
\end{enumerate}
