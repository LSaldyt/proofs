\problem{Negation}

Consider the statement ``Marlene has brown hair''. When asked to negate this statement, some students are apt to say ``Marlene has blonde hair'' (Really, which students?). Explain why this is incorrect (Why does this problem have a hint\ldots seriously?)

\solution

\part 

Obviously, Marlene could have any color of hair \emph{besides} brown. For instance, it could be red, not blonde.
