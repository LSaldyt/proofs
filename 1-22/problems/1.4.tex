\problem{Comic Logic}

Consider the following assertions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All cats have four legs
    \item I have four legs
    \item I am a cat
\end{enumerate}

Are the assertions statements or predicates?
Construct a truth table for ``If A and B, then C''
Now consider the actual truth values of the assertions made by the dog. Cross out the lines of the truth table that don't apply \emph{in this particular instance}.

\solution

\part 

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|}
    \hline
    Line & A & B & C & $(A \wedge B) \Rightarrow C$ \\
    \hline
    1 & T & T & T & T \\
    2 & T & T & F & F \\
    3 & T & F & T & T \\
    4 & T & F & F & T \\
    5 & F & T & T & T \\
    6 & F & T & F & T \\
    7 & F & F & T & T \\
    8 & F & F & F & T \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

In reality, both A and B are true, but C is clearly not. Therefore, only the first line of the truth table is ``applicable'' to the scenario in a technical sence.
