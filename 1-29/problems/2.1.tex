\problem{Pondering Counting}

What would a theory of counting look like in terms of sets?
If I say "These two sets have the same number of elements," what does that mean mathematically? 
If I say, "This set has twice as many elements as that set," what does \emph{that} mean?
How might we define this rigorously?

\solution

\part 

Two sets $A$ and $B$ would have the same number of elements if every element in set $A$ corresponded to an element in set $B$.
Similarly, if a set $B$ has twice as many elements as a set $A$, then there are two elements in $B$ for each element in set $A$.
