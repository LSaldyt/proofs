\begin{theorem}
Given two distinct points $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $R^2$, there exists a unique line passing through the two points. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A line is defined as either $y = mx + n$ ($n$ is used to distinguish from $b$, which is already defined), or $x = l$, where $m$, $n$, and $l$ are real numbers.

If $a = c$, then the line is vertical and takes the form $x = l$, where $l = a = c$.
No other value of $l$ will work, because if another value for $l$ is chosen, then $l \neq a \neq c$ and therefore neither point is on the line.
Therefore in this case the line is unique.

If $a \neq c$, then the line takes the form $y = mx + n$. In this case, $m$ is defined as $\frac{(b - d)}{(a - c)}$, and $n$ is then solved for as $b = \frac{(b-d)}{(a-c)} * a + n$. This means that $n = b - \frac{(b-d)}{(a-c)} * a$. Since both $m$ and $n$, the defining variables of the line, are in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, the line is unique with respect to the points.
\end{proof}
