\problem{4.3.10}

Let the set $A$ be $\{1..6\}$. Suppose a relation $r$ is defined as: \\
$\{(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)\}$ \\
For each $\alpha \in A$, find $T_{\alpha}$, and then find $\Omega_r$ (Short answer only).

\solution

\part 

Consider each element in $A$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $T_1 = \{1\}$ 
    \item $T_2 = \{2, 3, 5\}$
    \item $T_3 = \{5\}$
    \item $T_4 = \{2, 3, 5\}$
    \item $T_5 = \{2, 3, 5\}$
    \item $T_6 = \varnothing$
\end{itemize}

Thus, $\Omega_r$ is the set $\{\{1\}, \{5\}, \{2, 3, 5\}, \varnothing\}$.
