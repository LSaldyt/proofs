\problem{4.2.26}

Let $A$ be a partially ordered set that has the least upper bound property. Then every nonempty subset of $A$ that is bounded below has a greatest upper bound. (Or: Every partially ordered set with the least upper bound property also has the greatest lower bound property). (Hint: Use Lemma 4.2.25).
