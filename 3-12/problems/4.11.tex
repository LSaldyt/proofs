\problem{4.11}

Consider $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{N})$ under the partial ordering $\subseteq$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give an example of a nonempty subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{N})$ with no greatest element.
    \item Let $K = \{\{2, 3, 4, 12\}, \{3, 6, 9, 12\}, \{1, 2, 3, 4,4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\}$. Find three upper bounds for $K$ and three lower bounds for $K$ in $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{N})$. Does $K$ have a least upper bound? Does $K$ have a greatest upper bound?
    \item Let $X$ be any set. Suppose that $K$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{N})$, ordered under $\subseteq$. How would you construct the least upper bound of $K$? How about the greatest lower bound of $K$?
\end{enumerate}
