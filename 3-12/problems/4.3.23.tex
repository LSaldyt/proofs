\problem{4.3.23}

Show that the following relations $r$ on the specified set $S$ are equivalence relations. In each case do this in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item By identifying the equivalence classes and noting that they partition $S$.
\item By showing directly that $r$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $S = \{p : p \text{ is a person in Ohio}\}$. A rel B is A and B were born in the same year.
    \item $S = \mathcal{Z}$. a rel b is abs(a) == abs(b)
\end{enumerate}
