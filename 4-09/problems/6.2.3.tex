\problem{6.2.3}

Let $a$, $b$ be natural numbers. Suppose $a = qb + r$ with $0 \leq r < b$. What does the division algorithm yield when $-a$ is divided by $b$? Justify your answer.
Those natural numbers $n$ that, when divided into $m$ using the division algorithm, yield a remainder of zero have a special status with respect to $m$. We say that $n$ divides $m$ evenly or simply that $n$ divides $m$.

\solution

\part 

Clearly, $-a$ is not a natural number. However, since $q$ divides positive $a$, $-q$ divides $-a$, such that $-a = -qb - r$, by algebraic manipulation.
