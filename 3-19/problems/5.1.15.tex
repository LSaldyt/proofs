\problem{5.1.15}

For each function $f \colon \mathcal{R} \to \mathcal{R}$, either show that $f$ is onto or prove that it is not.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + 6$
\item $f(x) = sin(x)$
\item $f(x) = x^3 - x$
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

This function is onto. $x = 2y - 12$ shows that any $y$ in $Y$ (where $Y$ is the co-domain) is reachable by arbitrary $x$.

\part

Consider $y = 1.1$. There is no $x$ for which $sin(x) = 1.1$.

\part

This function is onto. Since every odd-degree polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root, this root is usable to reach a given $y$ by arbitrary $x$.
