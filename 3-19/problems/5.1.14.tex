\problem{5.1.14}

For each function $f \colon \mathcal{R} \to \mathcal{R}$, either show that $f$ is one-to-one or prove that it is not.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + 6$
\item $f(x) = sin(x)$
\item $f(x) = x^3 - x$
\end{enumerate}

\solution

\part 

This function is one-to-one. Any given $y = f(x)$ is mapped to by $x = 2y - 12$. 
Suppose two values of $x$, call them $a$ and $b$, mapped onto the same $y$.
This would imply $y = \frac{a}{2} + 6$ and $y = \frac{b}{2} + 6$, which implies that $a = b$, and thus $f$ is one-to-one, by contradiction.

\part

This function is not one-to-one. For instance, $0$ is mapped to by multiples of $\pi$, so, for instance, $0$ and $\pi$ map onto the same value, and the function is not one-to-one.

\part

This function is not one-to-one. Consider $y = 0$. This is true both when $x = 1$, or $x = 0$, and so the function is not one-to-one.
