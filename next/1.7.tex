\problem{Line creation proof}

Suppose that (a, b) and (c, d) are two distinct points in R^2. Prove that there exists a unique line passing through the two points. 

\solution

\part 

A line is defined as a point and a slope, or $y = mx + e$ ($e$ is used to distinguish from $b$, which is already defined). 
For a line to pass through (a, b) and (c, d), it must have a certain fixed slope and intercept, i.e. $b = ma + e$ and $c = md + e$. 
These two equations give unique values for the line\ldots
