\problem{Free Variables and Predicates (1.1)}

Suppose we understand the free variable $z$ to refer to (a) books, (b) automobiles, and (c) pencils.
For each context, give an examples where the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For all $z$, A(z) is true.
    \item For all $z$, B(z) is false, but there exists at least one $z$ that makes B(z) true.
\end{itemize}

\solution

\part 

Assuming books means literary books (which excludes books that are empty or consist of only pictures):
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``A(z) = z contains words.``
    \item ``B(z) = z is about russian history``
\end{itemize}

\part

Assuming automobiles doesn't include tanks or robots:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``A(z) = z has wheels``
    \item ``B(z) = z is painted red``
\end{itemize}

\part
Pencils seem to be well defined.
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``A(z) = z can write``
    \item ``B(z) = z is mechanical``
\end{itemize}
