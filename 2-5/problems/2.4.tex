\problem{Counting and Indexing}

What is the connection between questions 2.1 and 2.3?

\part 

Question 3 describes set-indexing, and and question 1 describes a theory of counting. 
It seems that set indexing certainly relies on counting, since an index is something which enumerates positions between two numbers (i.e. that counts).
However, since both of these formalisms are describing nearly the same thing, it is very possible that if one was found first, it would more or less contain the other
(i.e. if one found a theory of set indexing before counting, they would find that their indexing theory actually contained counting, even if it wasn't explicit).
