\problem{Subset of Intersection}

Let $A$, $B$, and $X$ be sets. Prove that $X \in A \cap B \Leftrightarrow X \subseteq A and X \subseteq B$.

\solution

\part 

In general, $C$ is a subset of $D$ if (and only if), for every element $c$ of $C$, $c$ is an element of D.
$C$ intersection $D$ is defined as the set of all elements $x$ such that both $x$ is in $C$ and $x$ is in $D$.
Combining these two definitions, for every element $x$ in the set $X \subseteq A\capB$, it is true that $x$ is in $A$ intersection $B$, and thus also true that $x$ is in $A$, and that $x$ is in $B$.
