\problem{Induction 1}

Let $n \in \mathcal{N}$. Conjecture a formula for:

$$a_n = \frac{1}{(1)(2)} + \frac{1}{(2)(3)} + ... + \frac{1}{(n)(n + 1)}$$

\solution

\part 

\begin{theorem}
The formula $a_n = \frac{n}{n + 1}$ describes the summation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Proceeding by induction, it is first established that the formula works for $a_1$, because $a_1 = \frac{1}{(1) * (2)} = \frac{1}{2}$.
Then, suppose the formula is true for an arbitrary $n \geq 1$, i.e. that $a_n = \frac{n}{n + 1}$.
From this, $a_{n + 1} = \frac{n}{n + 1} + \frac{1}{(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{n^2 + 2n + 1}{(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{(n + 1)(n + 1)}{(n + 1)(n + 2)} = \frac{n + 1}{n + 2}$.
By induction, this formula describes the summation $a_n$.

\end{proof}

\section{Scratch work}

$a_1 = (1/2)$
$a_2 = (1/2) + (1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3$
$a_3 = (1/2) + (1/6) + (1/12) = 9/12 = 3/4$

A likely formula is $a_n = (n/n+1)$
